# Sleepiness-Fatigue in Pilots

Over the past few decades, concerns about labor-life quality and health have grown significantly, sparking extensive discussions within both industry and legislative bodies. In the specific context of civil aviation, sleep quality stands out as a critical factor directly linked to the regularity and duration of pilot workloads. In Brazil, the *Lei do Aeronauta* (Law of the Airman) enacted in 1984 (Brasil, 1984) established regulations for the maximum duration of workloads and mandated a minimum number of monthly days off for pilots. Recognizing the need to improve the quality of life for commanders and co-pilots, this law was revised in 2017. The revisions specifically increased the number of monthly days off and decreased the permitted duration of workloads. This consultancy aims to quantify the impact of irregular workloads on pilot quality of life by focusing on two key proxies: perceived fatigue and sleepiness.
